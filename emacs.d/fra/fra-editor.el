;; As you've probably noticed, Lisp has a lot of parentheses.
;; Maintaining the syntactical correctness of these parentheses
;; can be a pain when you're first getting started with Lisp,
;; especially when you're fighting the urge to break up groups
;; of closing parens into separate lines. Luckily we have
;; Paredit, a package that maintains the structure of your
;; parentheses for you. At first, Paredit might feel a little
;; odd; you'll probably need to look at a tutorial (linked
;; below) or read the docs before you can use it effectively.
;; But once you pass that initial barrier you'll write Lisp
;; code like it's second nature.
